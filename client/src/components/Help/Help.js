          This web application will help you to learn touch typing, which means
          typing through muscle memory without using your eyesight to find the
          keys on the keyboard. It can improve your typing speed and accuracy
          dramatically. The opposite is hunt-and-peck typing, a method of typing
          in which you look at the keyboard instead of the screen, and use only
          the index fingers.
